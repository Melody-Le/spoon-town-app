Spoon town is my first project, what help me alot to prastice the knowledge what I learn in the unit 1:

- OOP concept, with private / public method
- DOM manipulating, Bubbling and delegation event
- Get data from API and make Application become the usefull application for user
- Async - await.
- Besides I also have chance to pratice to work with Github, do Pull request, Git branch.

## Challenges Faced:

---

- The order of event in applicaiton took me more time to understand.
- half of the time, I faced silly mistake, like: forget to declare variable, or put funciton in the wrong line.
- Clean code.
- Dont have enough time to build all of my love features.
- Mindset when trying to solve problem. It took me alot of time because I go in the wrong way.
